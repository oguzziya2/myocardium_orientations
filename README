this is the script that takes 4 heat diffusion results
and produces layer IDs in layers.dat file
and fiber orientations, in fibers.vtu file
implementations from bayer et al 2012 and perotti et al 2015
9 layer ids are between 11-19
diffusion result files should be result_A.vtu,...,result_D.vtu
and temperature field should have the name HS_Temperature
this code is only tested with simvascular's heat cond. output
layer ids look like

                 base
              __     __ 		 
	    /	 \ /  	\
